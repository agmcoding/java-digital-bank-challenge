# Java Digital Bank Challenge

##Hi there!
This code was developed by me for a bootcamp challenge.
The description/scenario was:
"A bank offers its clients 2 types of accounts (checking and savings), 
which have the functionality of deposit, withdrawal and transfer (between accounts within the bank institution)".

Suggestions to improve this code will be much appreciated =D .
